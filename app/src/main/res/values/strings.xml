        Hi there!
        <br/><br/>
        To use this keyboard you have to enable it in the settings of the device and, then, select
        it from the list of enabled keyboards when you are entering text. You can see a <a
        href="">video here</a>.
        <br/><br/>
        This is a test. Some people have shown interest in having a keyboard for phonetics and I have
        tried to build one. I do not have any use for it, so I am very interested in hearing from
        you, someone who is looking for this kind of keyboard. Please, e-mail me at
        <a href="mailto:hoardingsinc@gmail.com?subject=Feedback%20about%Phonetic%20Keyboard">hoardingsinc@gmail.com</a>
        with suggestions or problems you have. Any feedback will be welcomed!
