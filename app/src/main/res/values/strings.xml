        This is a keyboard designed to help who have such a hard time with spelling that sometimes
        their guesses can\'t even get close enough for auto correct to suggest something useful.
        This is quite common for people with dyslexia or dysgraphia,
        <br/><br/>
        This keyboard allows you to type words phonetically, using the international phonetic
        alphabet (IPA). As you type the auto correct will suggest to you correctly spelled words
        that start with the pronunciation of the ipa symbols you typed
        <br/><br/>
        To use this keyboard you have to 1) enable it in the settings of the device and 2) select
        it from the list of enabled keyboards when you are entering text. The two buttons below will
        take you directly to the two required screens.
        <br/><br/>
        You also need to build the pronunciation database on the first use. This should hawe started
        on its own, and you should see a progress bar below. If it hasn\'t, you can touch the build
        dictionary button.
