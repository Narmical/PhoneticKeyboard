# PhoneticKeyboard
A phonetic keyboard for Android

This is a proof of concept: an attempt to create a keyboard for writing phonetic transcriptions of English words using the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet).

I've developed it in my spare time because some people showed interested in it. It works in my device in the applications I have tested it. However, I don't know if it will work in your device. It will depend on the application you are using and the font that the application chooses, which I can't control; if the font doesn't have the phonetic symbols, there's nothing I can do.
