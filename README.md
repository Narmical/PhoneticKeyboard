## An android keyboard where you type with sounds and auto correct suggests correctly spelled english words

This keyboard uses the international phonetic alphabet (IPA) as its keys. As you type the auto correct will present words that start with the pronunciation that you have entered.

I had this bright idea because I have dysgraphia and normal spell check leaves me guessing sometimes. I can't even get close enough to have the right word show up sometimes. I hope this is also useful for people with dyslexia.

With this keyboard you can directly enter the sounds of the word, and you will be suggested words that start with those sounds. There is aa bit of a leaning curve in leaning IPA and then getting used to thinking about the pronunciations.

The pronunciations are taken from the CMU Pronunciation dictionary and thus conform to General American
